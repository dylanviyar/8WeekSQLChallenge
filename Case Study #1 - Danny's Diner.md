## 1. Introduction

Danny wants to use data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Provided are 3 key datasets : `sales`, `menu` and `members` to undergo the analysis.

## 3. The Data

Utilizing the GUI MySQLWorkbench, we can begin to understand and view the data using `SELECT` statements:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM members;
```

```SQL
SELECT * FROM menu;
```

```SQL
SELECT * FROM sales
LIMIT 15;
```

## 4. Data Analysis 

Please Note: Analysis for this Case Study and all the following Case Studies in this repository are conducted by answering business questions provided by the data apprenticeship [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/)!

### Question #1: What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

```SQL
SELECT customer_id,
SUM(price) AS total_spent FROM sales
JOIN menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
```
Steps:
- Use **JOIN** to join the `sales` table with the `menu` table on the `product_id`
- **GROUP BY** the `customer_id` 
- **SUM** the price column to aggregate the groups and find the total amount spent by each customer.

#### Question #2: How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

```SQL
SELECT customer_id, 
COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS NumOfVisits
FROM sales 
GROUP BY customer_id;
```
Steps:
- **GROUP BY** `customer_id`
- **COUNT** the **DISTINCT** `order_date` to determine the amount of unique days that the customer visited the restaurant

#### Question #3: What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?

```SQL
WITH ordered_sales AS(
SELECT customer_id,
	order_date,
	DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY sales.customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS my_rank,
    menu.product_name
FROM sales
JOIN menu ON menu.product_id = sales.product_id
)

SELECT customer_id,
product_name 
FROM ordered_sales
WHERE my_rank = 1
GROUP BY customer_id, product_name;
```
Steps: 
- Create a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `ordered_sales` in which you utilize the window function **DENSE_RANK** partitioned over `customer_id` ordered by `order_date` (effectively creating rankings of earliest date associated with each unique customer id)
- To obtain the first item purchased, we can **SELECT** the `product_name` from the CTE and use the **WHERE** clause to find the row in which the ranking is at the first position i.e: *WHERE my_rank = 1*\

#### Question #4: What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?

```SQL
